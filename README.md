## Why?

I wanted to implement my own Forth compiler for the [VICERA](https://github.com/vicera)
but I also wanted to write an interpreter so I can play arround with it on my
computer. So I decided to make a flexible way to make it run on both archs
without having to write 2 different implementations.
